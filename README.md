1. Project Title: Spotify Listening Behavior Dashboard in Power BI

2. Short Description / Purpose: This project involves the development of a dynamic and interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze one year of Spotify streaming data. The dashboard provides detailed
insights into listening patterns, track and artist popularity, day and hour-wise engagement trends, and playlist activity. The primary objective is to visualize personal music consumption habits and extract
meaningful behavioral patterns that can be scaled for music analytics or marketing applications.

3. Tech Stack and Tools: Power BI (Visualization and Reporting) Power Query Editor: Used for data import, cleaning, and transformation. DAX: Used for calculated fields such as: Total Tracks Played, Unique
Artists Count, Total Minutes Streamed
Visualizations: KPI Cards (Total Artists, Tracks, Playlists) Line Charts (Monthly Trends) Donut Charts (Weekday vs. Weekend Comparison) Horizontal Bar Charts (Top Artists & Tracks) Stacked Bar Charts (Minutes
